# youtube-courses

In this repo you'll find different jupyter nooteboks on some courses I took on youtube of Python libraries, such as OpenCV, Pandas and MatPlotLib. These notes are not extensive material for advanced coders, but will serve for begginers as a sort of consulting material in case it's needed.

I hope you find it useful.
