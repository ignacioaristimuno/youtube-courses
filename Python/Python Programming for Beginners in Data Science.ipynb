This is because, we usually will be using mathematical libraries especially designed for Data Science as NumPy or Pandas, and we can not use this math functions in those libraries. We do have to __import__ math.\n",
    "\n",

    " - __ceil()__ transforms a real number to the closest integer that is greater or equal than the real number.\n",
    " - __floor()__ transforms a real number to the closest integer that is lower or equal than the real number.\n",
    " - __trunc()__ ignores the real part of a real number so it converts to an integer.\n",
    " - __exp()__ is basically the exponential function: e^(x).\n",
    " - __pow(m,n)__ means the function that represents: m^n.\n",
    " - __sqrt()__ is basically the square root of a number.\n",
    " - __log()__ is the log in base e. If we want another base, we can add it with a comma: log(7,10) is the log(7) with a base of 10.\n",
    " - __pi__ =  3,1415...\n",
    " - __e__ = 2,7...\n",
    " - __sin()__ sine function in __radians__, if we want it in degrees we can use the following math function:\n",
    " - __randians__ converts a number in degrees to radians.\n",
    " - __cos()__ cosine function.\n",
    " - __tan()__ tangent function.\n",
    " - __sum(n)__ is the sum of all the integers between 0 and n.\n",
    " - __fsum()__ it is a sum of floating point numbers, useful with lists of real numbers; we would isea fsum(list).\n",
    " - __gcd()__ determines the greater common divisor between two numbers-\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.1 What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python; it stands for Numeric Python. NumPy contains among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    " - Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    " - Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    " - Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an __efficient__ multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 What makes NumPy faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are data structures that manages data as if it is a column with several rows. In lists, each element of the list is stored in the RAM but not continuous to the other elements of the list, so each calculation we want to do with all the elementos of the list, we have to acces multiple memory spaces that are not continuously arranged.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, NumPy handles adding or appending elements by creating new arrays, storing all the elements continuously and deleting the prior array; this has the advantage that me computer does not has to look after the memory space in which each element is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason, is that, under the hood, NumPy uses C programming language, which makes it faster than Python itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the most fundamental structure of NumPy. AN array is almost as a list but is not uniquely one-dimension, it can be of a n-dimension big. One-dimension arrays are called vectors, two-dimension arrays are called matrix and if more than two dimensions it is called a multi-dimension array.\n",
